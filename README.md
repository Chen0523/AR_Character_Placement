# AR_Character_Placement

Backup Code for masther thesis. This Repo simulates a real scenario in Unity, where the user with Camera running around in the 3D room, during which the virtual character shall find the optimal location to stay at or walk to.

### Introduction
The Game Technology Center is collaborating with the Media Technology Center and DisneyResearch|Studios to develop autonomous virtual characters that can navigate and interact with the real environment through augmented reality (AR). One aspect of this research is the challenge of positioning the AR character in an optimal way relative to the current environment, a region of interest, the user’s point of view, as well as optional (author) constraints. While there has been a lot of research in the area of placing virtual cameras at an optimal location, works on optimally placing objects given an environment and a virtual camera are still rare. A first use-case for this technology is a virtual museum guide that ensures to not cover the exhibits with its body, while still staying in the user’s view.


### Task Description
The first task is to explore related work regarding optimal camera/object placement and investigate how to adapt them to our use case. The second task is to propose and implement a model with which the optimality of a location for the character can be determined. The third task is to apply this model in the context of an AR museum experience, with the stretch goal of making the small position adjustments look visually pleasing. The fourth task is to evaluate the implemented system in a user study.
